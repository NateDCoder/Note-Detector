# Note Detector

This is the first version of a Note Detector, a simple script that detects circular shapes representing notes in an image. The primary functionality is based on basic image processing and circle detection techniques using OpenCV. I did a bunch of random copy and pasting and tuning numbers so I dont know entirely how everything works and if you run into problems I might not know how to solve it but dont be afraid to ask any question and I will try my best to answer it.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/note-detector.git
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy
